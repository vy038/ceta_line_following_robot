The code used for a line following robot which won our school second place in the region at the CETA robolympics. The code takes QTI data from 6 separate sensors (3 on each side of the line) to ensure that the robot is always centred on the line, adjusting the motor speed when necessary. Making the robot high voltage and giving it lots of sensors allowed the robot to go at extremely high speeds without falling off the line.
